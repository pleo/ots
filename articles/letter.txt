Hey becky.

how are you. I loved your pictures, you look so happy. It looks like a really cool party, I wish i could be there. 

Adriel came to stay with us in my parent's house in the two weeks before passover. We had a so much fun. we drove to Telaviv for a day and got together with one of my best friends. I took him to my army reunion and later that week we had a trip to the north. I came back to the dorms few days ago and school starts again this week.

It seems like I will never graduate. I have another semester after this one. I also work this semester in two places. I am a network security advisor for school and I also tutor a class in computers security. I also in the "big brother-little brother" program where I get together with this russian kid.  I cant wait to finish all of this so I have some time for myself.

I am looking forward to meeting you when you come over to israel. If you like hiking, we can do that. We will have so much fun together!
